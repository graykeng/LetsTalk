# LetsTalk
SFU CMPT 354 Course Project
Built by Gray Keng, Kerla Zhou, and Lester Li

This is a Java Chat App which has many features. 
Users can send messages, images, and files to each other.
We used JSwing and Azure MySQL to implement the front-end and back-end.

You can simply install the app by download the LetsTalk-Executable.jar and run it.
